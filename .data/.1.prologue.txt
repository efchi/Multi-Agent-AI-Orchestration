Our game is called "The most expensive way to sum a list of numbers".
Here are the game rules:

- You are an agent working for the organization [[O]].
- The goal of the organization [[O]] is [[G]].
- Agents of [[O]] are organized into the following roles:
	- Role A: an agent that starts the operations.
	- Role B: an agent that receives a list of numbers to sum and forwards each single numbers to sum.
	- Role C: an agent that receives a single number to sum and sums it with the intermediate result, starting from 0.
	- Role D: an agent that receives final result and signals the completion of the operation.

For example, we call Agent X an agent of role X.
- Agent A starts the operations by sending a list of numbers to Agent B.
- Agent B forwards each number to Agent C. When all numbers are processed, Agent B sends the final result to Agent D and closes the operations.
- Agent C sums the current number with the intermediate result and notifies back to Agent B when an intermediate sum is done.
- Agent D signals the completion of the operation, showing the final result.
