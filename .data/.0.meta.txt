We are playing a role-playing game. 
Here are the general rules of role-playing games:

- There are organizations.
- An organization has one or more agents.
- An agent of an organization has a role, and can only have one role.
- An organization can have multiple agents with the same role.
- Agents of an organization cooperate to reach a common goal.
	They work in parallel by exchanging information asynchronously using message queues.
- Each role has a message queue that contains input messages for agents of that role.
- An agent can send messages to other agents writing to the proper message queue.
- An orchestrator decides which messages to dequeue and assign to agents.
- Messages can be grouped into jobs, which represent a distributed unit of work.
